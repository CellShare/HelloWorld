Problems that need solving 

Hey Everybody, 

I started a startup and there a some heady technical issues I need to overcome. i will be adding them to this file, but for now I got a pretty big issue. It concerns the ability to get an app onto an iPhone without there being an internet connection. Now, I think I found a solution but I need you guys to help me out on it. The solution doesn't have any technical merit behind it; I am just spitballing. Basically, I want to take what Diawa.com does and  place it into a Wifi Enabled hard drive. This will allow me to store the apps onto the hard drive and then use its Wifi capability to allow an iPhone to download and install the app. Do you think this method has merit? Is there an alternative idea out there?
